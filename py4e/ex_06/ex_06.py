# This code snippet is written in Python and it performs the following operations:
# It creates a string variable str with the value 'Ehfgjg_OI_POKK: 0.8475'
# It uses the find() method to find the index of the first space character in the string. The find() method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring in the string.
# It extracts the substring starting from the index of the first space character (which is ipos+2) and assigns it to a new variable piece
# It converts the piece string to a floating-point number using the float() function and assigns it to a new variable value
# Finally, it prints the value of value, which is 0.8475
# In summary, this code snippet extracts the value of a number from a string and converts it to a floating-point number.
